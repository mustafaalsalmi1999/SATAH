SATAH (meaning surface in Arabic, Hindi and Urdu) stands for Surface Analysis Tool for Applied cHemistry is a multipurpose modeling tool for surfaces and interfaces. This package will initially aim at (i) building unit cells based on experimental data, (ii) calculate theoretical lattice parameters, (iii) calculate equation of states, (iv) build supercells, (v) model catalytic sites, (vi) generate input files, (vii) analyze output files of popular quantum chemical softwares and finally (viii) combine with Abins to relate vibrational calculations with inelastic neutron spectroscopic measurements. It is also planned to implement modules, which will be capable of computationally inexpensive modeling of active sites of catalyst and analyzing chemical bonding using that deep learning.
